        <h3> Replay your Melbourne, Australia Trip</h3>

        <p> I only stayed a week over in Melbourne. <ins>This was the best trip of the year by far.</ins></p>
        
        <h4> The Big Wedding</h4>
        <p> The main reason I went here. To see my good friend get married.
        </p>
        
        <h4> In the City</h4>
        <p> As soon as we landed, we explored. Our AirBnB was in the city, so it was easy to go around.
        </p>

        <h4> Zoo and the Beaches</h4>
        <p> The newlyweds and the in-laws took us to the zoo to see kangaroos. Then we headed to the beach. The beach was beautiful and clear.
        </p>

        <h4> Making Friends</h4>
        <p> I met a lot of good people over there. They took us to hang out and play basketball. We had a blast!
