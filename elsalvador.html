        <h3> Replay your San Salvador, El Salvador Trip</h3>
        
        <h4> MIDI Cuida MOU</h4>
        <p> My Church did medical missions here. We got recognized as partners and held an event to commemorate with our overall preacher. I was part of the receptionist team.</p>

        <h4> Going around</h4>
        <p> Where we stayed there were so many malls. So we ended up exploring them.</p>

        <h4> National Library of El Salvador</h4>
        <p> After the event we visited their famous library. It was huge! There were so many floors and things to do. They even had video games!</p>
