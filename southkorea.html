        <h4> Meyongdong</h4>
        <p> This is where I went shopping. I bought a lot of things, including some sunglasses.</p>

        <h4> Banpo Hangang Park</h4>
        <p> I went here at night with some friends I made there. The water show was pretty. We walked under the bridge to get there.</p>

        <h4> Seongsu</h4>
        <p> I went cafe hopping over here. They also had a big skincare store where I bought most of my stuff from. The pastries were delicious!</p>

        <h4> Dongmyo Flea Market</h4>
        <p> I went here to buy some cool secondhand items. Unfortunately, I didn't find anythng to my liking. But my mom did. A lot.</p>

        <h4> Hongdae</h4>
        <p> I went here with a friend to eat some good food. Little did we know that this was also the red light district. But the views were nice too.</p>
