        <p> Good food, good views, good skincare, it was SO good.<ins> I wish i could have bought more snacks. Instead I bought too much skincare.</ins></p>
        <h4> Meyongdong <span lang="ko">명동</span></h4>
        <p> This is where I went shopping. I bought a lot of things, including some sunglasses.</p>

        <h4> Banpo Hangang Park <span lang="ko">반포한강공원</span></h4>
        <p> I went here at night with some friends I made there. The water show was pretty. We walked under the bridge to get there.</p>

        <h4> Seongsu-dong <span lang="ko">성수동</span></h4>
        <p> I went cafe hopping over here. They also had a big skincare store where I bought most of my stuff from. The pastries were delicious!</p>

        <h4> Dongmyo Flea Market <span lang="ko">동묘벼룩시장</span></h4>
        <p> I went here to buy some cool secondhand items. Unfortunately, I didn't find anythng to my liking. But my mom did. A lot.</p>

        <h4> Hongdae <span lang="ko">홍대</span></h4>
        <p> I went here with a friend to eat some good food. Little did we know that this was also the <del>red light district</del>. But the views were nice too.</p>
