          Good food, good views, good skincare, it was SO good.<ins>
            I wish i could have bought more snacks. Instead I bought too much
            skincare.</ins

              This is where I went shopping. I bought a lot of things, including
              some sunglasses.

              I went here at night with some friends I made there. The water
              show was pretty. We walked under the bridge to get there.

              I went cafe hopping over here. They also had a big skincare store
              where I bought most of my stuff from. The pastries were delicious!

              I went here to buy some cool secondhand items. Unfortunately, I
              didn't find anythng to my liking. But my mom did. A lot.

              I went here with a friend to eat some good food. Little did we
              know that this was also the
              <del>red light district</del>entertainment district. But the views
              were nice too.
